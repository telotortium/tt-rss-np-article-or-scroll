# tt-rss-np-article-or-scroll

Plugin for [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org) to remap the "n" and "p"
keybindings to scroll in the articles rather than move between them when the
article is longer than one screen.

I believe this was the behavior before 2021, so I'm restoring it.

# Installation

- Copy the files in this repository into a directory named
  `np_article_or_scroll` within your `plugins.local` directory (or `plugins` if
  `plugins.local` does not exist.
- Activate it in "Preferences > Plugins", or inside config.php for the whole
  instance.
